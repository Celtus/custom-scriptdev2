-- First Part:

From day_1 you should have learnt these things:
* Meaning of working tree and index: The working tree are the actual files on your file system, the index is the history information
* The concept of branches: A branch is a branch of the history index

Also you should be able to switch between branches with > git checkout and to check the state of your working tree related to the index with > git status

This part now should introduce you to know how to actual see the history.

- (0) Excursion: The pager 'less'
This is especially important for Windows user!

When using Git via Git bash, the default tool set is the archaic tool set every *nix fan will have learnt by heart, but they can be extremely weird from Windows view.

In old times, when there was nothing except console and there were no possibilities to scroll in the text, console environments had the so called pager programs, which were used to be able to scroll in output.

Assume you would have an enormous amount of text, so if you would push it directly onto the console, you would not be able to read anything, because it would be way too fast.

So, the idea is to give the output to a program -- the pager -- which allows you to scroll up and down in the output.

Default pager on *nix is 'less' - which Git bash uses by default to show the history (or many other things).
You can scroll in there with the arrow keys or a whole page by the space bar.
And most important: You quit less by pressing "q"

The man page for less can be found here: http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?less
(Disclaimer: I don't take responsibility for brain damage caused by any provided link here!)
Anyhow: A better "guide" for less to link would be appreciated, but trying to search for "how to less" kind of doesn't work.

Exercise 1: Try to find a better less how-to and take a look
Hint: add "unix" to your search attempt :)


- (1) Viewing the history of a branch in Git

OK, now we can look into the history of the current branch, this is done simply by
> git log
Just do so now :)

Remember: To close the output, type "q"

The most recent commits (see 3) might look like this:
< commit 1cebd00445e7bd92927f305e40225de1049d450c
< Author: Schmoozerd <schmoozerd@scriptdev2.com>

<     Initial Commit for the ICC Learning project

What does this show:
1) commit <someFancyNumbers> <-- this is the hash of the commit, which should globally uniquely identify any commit.
Usually it is enough to only take the first ~6 digits.
This is more or less the "name" of the commit
2) Author: <someNameAndEMail> <-- yes, this is the author of the commit
3) Date: <someDate> <-- when the commit was authored

4) Then comes the commit message, this is the message the author thought might be helpful to describe the commit


So - what is git log useful for?
With git log you are able to see the history, who did which changes, and in which order.
Also git log has a big amount of options, which help you to actually search for a specific commit (ie by author)

Exercise 2: If you have already submitted a patch to SD2, that got accepted it is likely that you are "author" of a commit.
Check with
> git log --author="yourNickName"
If you are not, pick anyone whom you think has contributed and look what git log --author tells you ;)

- (2) The structure of objects in the git history index

When you do a change, and make this change known to the history, then you have a "commit"

Any commit has:
* An author
* A commit hash (the strange numbers already seen in git log)
* The set of changes it describes (if you didn't change anything, there is no commit!)

* One previous commit on which the commit is done.

As of the last statement, you have a chain of commits. And this is your history!


- (3) View a commit
you can view a commit with
> git show <someIdentifier>

Exercise 3: Look into the commit 111cea5073191b, type
> git show 111cea5073191b
What commit does this refer to: What is the commit message? Who is the author? When was it committed?


- (4) How to access commits
Things are only useful if you can work with them, and to do so you need powerful ways to access them.
Git provides reasonable ways to "get to" a specific commit.

You have already seen the commit hash, this identifies a commit and hence is a great accessor (except that no one can remember endless amounts of hash-ids)

When you are on a local branch, "HEAD" always points to the top-most commit of your local branch.

A branchname always points to the HEAD commit of the branch with the branchname

"<Commit>~N" refers to "N commits before the commit <Commit>

Exercise 4: Look into a few commits, examples are:
> git show HEAD~1
> git show master
> git show master~304

Remember: To close the pager, type "q"

- (5) Advanced looking into the history:
Now that you know how commits are accessed, you are able to invoke more features from git log.
However I don't think that this is needed for our purposes just now, so if you are interested,
see http://book.git-scm.com/3_reviewing_history_-_git_log.html


== End of First Part

What this part was about:
* Knowing what a 'commit' means.
* Showing a commit ( git show )
* Knowing how to access various commits


-- Second Part

From the first part of today you should know what commits are, and how to find them.
Also you should feel safe about concepts as branches, working tree and index

Now it is time to start doing some own commits!


- (6) Why commit?

When you commit, you get the full power of Git to track your history.
Also commits are easier to merge and handle than changes that are just there.
Also with committing, you are able to provide extra information in the commit message to tell "what you have done why".

So, the golden rule of thumb is:
    Commit often, commit early!
And of course: Publish your commits! (More about this likely tomorrow)

- (7) How to commit:

The base command to commit changes is
> git commit
however this command alone won't make you very happy.

You must tell Git which changes you want to commit.
A very reasonable way is often, to commit all changes, like with
> git commit -a -m"My first commit"
Where
-a <= commit _all_ changes in all tracked files
-m <String> <= take <String> as commit message, note that I used ".." to mark the whole text as message

Example:
This commit was added with
> git commit -a -m"Day 2, Part 2 Howto git commit"


As this would only commit changes in already tracked files, you might wonder how to commit (changes to) new files.
You can add a new file with
> git add path/to/fileName
Then the file named fileName located in path/to/ will be committed with your next > git commit -a command

Remark for later: If you plan a couple of commits, it might be a good idea to fork a new branch and commit them there

By using these commands, the usual work flow in Git represents itself like this:

You edit a few files
> git commit -a -m "Some cool edits"
You edit more
> git commit -a -m"More cool edits"
You edit even more
> git commit -a -m"The coolest edits ever"

Then you check your work with
> git log
The topmost three commits should then be
    The coolest edits ever
    More cool edits
    Some cool edits

Exercise 5: Do some test commits
Suggested files to change might be found in icc_project\research

Exercise 6: Look at your work with git log

Special Exercises are not important to do right now, but if you feel confident or want to test some things feel free to explore a bit
Special Exercise 7: Add a new file to git and commit it
Special Exercise 8: Do the same in a branch, to start invoke > git checkout -b testing
(Remember: the -b will create a new branch, and git checkout switches to a branch)

Possible additional sources related to this topic:
http://book.git-scm.com/3_normal_workflow.html (unfortunately it seems the flash vids showing this are gone)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dhZ9BXQgc4 must also show this stuff, but I think I don't like the style of the speaker too much - but if you have time ;)

- (8) Undo Changes

This section will show up every now and then, because there are different ways to undo things, depending on what and how you want to undo.

It is not necessary, but I suggest to remove the testing changes from Ex. 5-7 from your icc_project branch.
Do so by switching into this branch with
> git checkout icc_project
and reset to origin state with
> git reset --hard origin/icc_project

- (9) Excursion: The editor 'vi'

You remember that Git uses by default the archaic pager 'less' in some cases?
They are even more hostile, because in some cases by default (when there is need to edit something) Git will start the well loved 'vi' editor.

The good news:
You can change the default editor to some editor that at least is usable for people who didn't suffer years of brain damage caused by vi and think this is a good editor :)
To change the default editor, look at this line carefully:
> git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
This is however only an example how it worked on my system.

However there are a few reasons why 'vi' is still worth knowing about:
* Every *nix system has vi, and it works nicely over ssh -- so it might be required some day to know at least the very basics
* Actually vi performs quite nicely related to big files
* Well, vi is very powerful

Besides I like it, refer to brain damage to understand why ;)

As vi originates in the golden ages when mice where only found under the desk of full-time hackers,
and not on the desk related to GUI editors, there was the very pressing question how to know if you want to invoke a command (ie "save" ) or when to write a word (ie "save" ).
Many editors solved this by using CTRL and similar for command mode, and normal typing else wise.
However vi went another way (because of more powerful features and because ctrl and similar caused trouble on telnet sessions).

So, what does vi:
vi has a few different modes, which can be switched and entered with a few buttons:
* The INSERT mode: When this mode is active, there is a "-- INSERT --" marked on the bottom of your console, and in this mode vi behaves like normal editors.
If you type things, they will show on the screen - so you will do what you expect from an editor: you will edit a file
* The command mode: In this mode, pressing keys are considered as commands, and do confusing things!

How to switch between the modes:
When you start vi you are in the command mode. Press "i" to start the insert mode.
When you are in the INSERT mode, press "Esc" to leave the INSERT mode and return to command mode.

Actually most people green to vi wonder about one thing most:
    How to close the damn program?
The answer is relatively easy:
You must be in the command mode, and then press ":". This will activate a special mode (for interested: ex-mode) in which you can type in commands.
the most useful commands are: (you don't need to press the ":" again)
:wq <= Write and Quit, which it does, and you will have manged to quit vi ;)
:q <= Only quit, to do so there must be no change
:q! <= Quit and discard changes you made

There are tons of docs for vi out there, maybe http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/vi-guide.xml is a good one.

Special Exercise 9: Do a few changes and use > git commit -a and experiment :)


== End of Second Part

What this part was about:
* Doing own commits with git commit
* Really encouraging to do own simple tests now!
